Multi-Client Chat Socket Programming Project

This is a socket programming-based Multichat program. 
This program allows us to chat as a group based on the IP address connected.
The programming language used here is Java.

To run the program, please follow these steps:
1. Open the files Client.java, Server.java, and ClientHandler.java using your favored IDE (plugins for Java might need to be installed).
2. Run the file Server.java first to run the server.
3. Now run the file Client.java (The IP address must be the one your device is connected to).
4. Enter your desired username for the group chat using the terminal.
5. A notification on the server terminal will appear.
6. Repeat the process from step 3 to join the chat.
7. You can now chat with each other in the terminal!
